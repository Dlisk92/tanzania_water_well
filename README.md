# Predicting Tanzania Water Well Functionality

## Project Goals/Overview

The purpose of this project was to accurately predict the condition of water wells in Tanzania. This is a multiclass classification problem as there are three different well conditions. Our goal is to create an effective model to help Tanzania maitenence operations ensure families access to clean water.

## Process
### Data Cleaning

1. The beginning of the 'Tanzanian_water_wells.ipynb' file shows the data processing stage. Notes are compiled in the file.

### Model Selection

![confusion_matrix](/images/confusion.png)

1. The bottom of the 'Tanzanian_water_wells.ipynb.ipynb' file is where our models are for the data. Comments can be found in the file.
2. After selecting our model we did a lot of parameter tuning which you can find right above creating a submission file.
